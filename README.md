# Layout Design of a CMOS Inverter
It consists of the simulation of a CMOS inverter and its layout design.
<p align="justify"> &emsp; Cadence Virtuoso suite is used to design and simulate the CMOS Inverter. The CMOS inverter has one pmos and one nmos; its gate terminals are connected to each other; source of the pmos is connected to vdd and source of the nmos is connected to ground; both the drains are connected to each other and the output is taken at this terminal. The diagramatic representation of the CMOS Inverter is shown in Fig. 1.</p>
